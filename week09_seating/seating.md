Assignment: Folder: week09_seating
Design an algorithm that would seat people more equitably.
Write up a description of your algorithm and save it as week09_seating/seating.pdf (or week09_seating/seating.md). Make sure this description states 
how it should improve equity and also how it might affect other concerns.NO CODE IS NEEDED OR EXPECTED HERE -- just a description -- but make a note
of implementation issues that might make your algorithm more practical or more difficult to implement
In class next week you will share your ideas and algorithms and ultimately decide on what to recommend to the airlines.

For the airplane seating algorithm to work, it needs to be fair and equitable for all single purchase tickets and family or group ticket purchases.  
We donâ€™t want families to be separated, especially from their children.  There are also different times of day and different times of year that 
different people take flights.  So for common holiday flights, there should be more seats saved for groups of 4 (a traditional family size) and 
some seats saved for single and double purchase.  Of the blocked off seating plan, they should have some economy and some regular price.  
(Generally there are less economy than regular price).  The same should be done for single and double occupancy.  Their prices might be a little 
higher during this peak season also.  For other travel times, there will more likely be more business travel and less large groups of families so 
make more seats for double occupancy economy than the family 3-4 seating.  Block off less family seating and have less economy for family and more
full price tickets.  

In both times of year, it will have priority for first come first served to obtain the economy tickets in each.  For families during peak seasons, 
(ie:  summer, school vacations) there will be more economy tickets and blocked off rows saved to ensure that families not be separated while still 
allowing for some single and double occupancy discount economy tickets.
